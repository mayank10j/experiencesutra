De-Stress Time with Muse and Oculus Rift DK2
--------------------------------------------

[EXPERIMENTS](http://experiencesutra.com/category/experiments/)

To experience peace does not mean that your life is always blissful. It means that you are capable of tapping into a blissful state of mind amidst the normal chaos of a hectic life.  
~ Jill Bolte Taylor

Stress and anxiety are a norm now. In a workplace, relaxation can help increase our productivity and also enhance our joyful moments on daily basis. I have tried to create an app to help you de-stress yourself on a busy and stressful day. The POC integrates brain waves with the virtual reality environment to create an immersive experience and help the user calm their mind.

The app is called “De-Stress Time” – Relaxation via Virtual Reality is like creating a calmer state of mind by watching picturesque landscape and listening calming sounds. You are not required to perform any action. You just need to be yourself, and relax. Soon your mind will be relaxed and you will be in a relaxed state.

The virtual landscape gives you a soothing effect and slowly calms your mind. Soon your mind is in a state where you are no longer thinking about the daily activities. Now, the blissful mind is enjoying the soothing landscape. The serene music along with the breathing sounds help you relax and guide you to breath in from your nose and breath out from your mouth making a “HA” sound, hence engaging in Deep Breathing.

“De-Stress Time” uses Muse headband (The Brain sensing Device)  to measure your brainwaves and oculus rift DK2 to show both the former restless state of mind and the latter relaxed state of mind. Muse is the first tool in the world that gives you accurate, real-time feedback on what’s happening in your brain when you meditate, whereas Oculus Rift is a virtual reality system that completely immerses you inside virtual worlds.

The user can get the realtime feedback of the brain activity via Muse in a virtual experience using the Oculus Rift and the user can calm the mind following the visuals in the VR.
