In an era where head-mounted virtual retinal displays such as the [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) and [Magic Leap](http://www.magicleap.com/#/home) are taking augmented reality to greater heights, here’s a rather retro and cost efficient approach to interacting with holograms in the real world.

Holozone uses [Pepper’s ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) in order to augment virtual objects in a physical space and a variety of mechanisms in order to interact with them.

An installation of this sort could be used in two fundamental ways:

1\. To overlay real objects with virtual components such that the User Interface reacts to the object, with emphasis on the real object and the interface working around it.


2\. To interact with virtual entities using objects or gestures in the physical world.

Cameras could be used to identify objects or detect gestures.

In the sample below we have used the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) to track a user’s hands.
