[EXPERIMENTS](http://experiencesutra.com/category/experiments/)

You’ve probably heard of an AI technique known as “style transfer” — or, if you haven’t heard of it, you’ve seen it. The process uses neural networks to apply the look and feel of one image to another. Style Transfer become quite popular after launch of [Prisma](https://prisma-ai.com/) app which transforms your photos into works of art using the styles of famous artwork and motifs.

Recently at Kepler Lab, we created something similar but with lots of flexibility and we are calling it ‘Project Chameleon’.  If you want to apply Pablo Picasso painting style or any other artistic style to your photo, Project Chameleon can do it for you.

[![Project Chameleon](http://experiencesutra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-18-1024x583.png)](http://experiencesutra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-18.png)

Apart from the already available styles, Project Chameleon has a capability of creating your own styles. You can upload any of the artistic photo and our style engine will create unique style filter based on the image that you have provided. So what it means? It means it is not limited to only popular artists. You can upload even your drawings and it will create style filter based on your drawing.

Here are some of the results:
