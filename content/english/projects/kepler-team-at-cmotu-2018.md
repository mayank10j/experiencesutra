KEPLER Team at CMOTu 2018
-------------------------

[PROJECTS](http://experiencesutra.com/category/projects/)

CMTOu is a year-long program combining elements of a corporate leadership development program with the rigor, challenge and learning of an executive MBA.

At CMTOu, we showcased installations which inspired the visitors to be curious and bring their imagination to life. The ideas were centered around the thought “The world needs the curious, the creative, and the courageous engineer – who inspires possibility and then brings it to life.”

The first installation was “ReDrawn” – a simple application with the objective of bringing your imagination to life. The experience was inspired by an older work of Zach Lieberman but with a twist. The basic principle of this experience was that anything painted on a sheet of white paper would get animated by simple hand gestures. The first reaction we got was WAIT! How is this even possible? But here comes the magic of Image Processing, Deep Learning and Augmented Reality. All these pieces of technology come together and make this magical experience seamless and possible.

The immediate next question from the visitors that popped up was ‘Hey, this is fun; but how does it translate to something useful for business?’ This is where we ask them to move to the Interactive Mirror experience.

The Interactive Mirror is a shopping assistant with the capabilities of a recommendation system. It classifies Men’s and Women’s clothing, recognizes apparel types and recommends similar products, suggests other items that the shopper might like and presents deals to the potential buyer. The Mirror also gives cross-recommendations and this latest feature was a winner with the stall visitors at the summit.

For the first time, the event was open to external guests and candidates and the level of interest exceeded our expectations. Overall CMTOu was a rich experience, for both external as well as intenal guests. From our perspective, CMTOu 2018 was a brilliant platform to interact with brilliant minds and exchanging thoughts on seeing around corners and reimagining the future.
