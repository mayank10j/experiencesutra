Interactive wall of stories
---------------------------

[PROJECTS](http://experiencesutra.com/category/projects/)

Stories are always fascinating and is considered to be the best form of communication. However they still have the problem of one sided conversation. We at kepler lab believe that story lived is better than story told. Interactive narrative have the potential of creating more immersive and playful experiences.

Interactive wall of stories is an experiment to explore the possibilities of leveraging things around us to tell interactive stories. The wall was programmed to sense touch, human presence and allowed playful interactions to tell inspiring stories of people who made impossible possible.

Run you hand on the wall and it can play music, pull a slingshot and the wall will start the story of India [mars mission](http://www.isro.gov.in/pslv-c25-mars-orbiter-mission), a triumph of low cost engineering and creativity. Stick the seeds on the wall and will tell the story of [Jadav payang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadav_Payeng) known as forrest man in India. There were many more stories. The wall was flat and constructed from canvas with embedded sensors and camera.

The installation was a show stopper at [Kyoorious](http://designyatra.com/) and highlighted the fact that there is tremendous value in crafting experiences that go beyond screens.
