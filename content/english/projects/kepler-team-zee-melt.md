[PROJECTS](http://experiencesutra.com/category/projects/)

When you go to technology conference, it is quite common to stumble upon terms like big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning but when you go to digital marketing conference and you hear marketing leaders talking about artificial intelligence and machine learning, one must say these technologies are really transforming the digital space in every industry.

During the last week of May, we participated in [Zee MELT](http://zeemelt.com/) – India’s biggest festival for disruptive marketing and communications. In its 3rd edition, #ZEEMELT brought together some of the biggest names in marketing, media and digital innovation and creativity, over two days at NSCI, Mumbai.

One part of the event was MELT expo where like everyone else, we had booth showcasing our capabilities and some of our recent work.  We showcased [touché](http://touche.world/) – An awarded Refreshable Braille Display and torch installation. Torch installation is our most recent work and we are yet to give it a proper name. It is a new way of interacting with your audience, in a form of non-linear storytelling, using actual torch as a medium. Instead of mouse, keyboard or even a touch, you can use torch as interaction medium and navigate through the content. There were four different stories projected on the wall. Once you go to the next screen, it has six hotspots and using the torch you can navigate to each hotspots and listen to micro-story associated with it. Here all six micro-stories are related but not in linear fashion so you will be able to understand the whole story only after you listen to all six micro-story. We had amazing response from the audience as well and they were able to figure out and interact with the installation on their own without any guidance. That’s the way intuitive interface should be designed. Isn’t it? The best part of any conference is you got to meet lots of interesting people and when you meet interesting people, interesting idea get generated and you get opportunity to look at things from a different perspective. We also met lots of interesting people – some of them were long-timer of this industry, some of them were quite new and few of them were just getting started. No matter how long they have been in this industry, everyone had something new and creative, to inspire and share with the community.

Other part of the event was conference. From CMOs and Head of Digital to Product Innovators, top-notch creatives, marketers and media professionals were at ZEE MELT:2017. Speakers included advertisers, data experts, creative directors, leading marketers, head of designs to award-winning authors. In spite of busy schedule at expo, we had opportunity to attend couple of session and they were quite amazing and inspiring. Here are some quotes from the event.

> “Service experience can be monetized. The whole service model, in fact, can be a market differentiator. Disruption is pervasive.” Saurabh Das – SapientRazorfish
> 
> “We need disruption in the media and that will come through with content. Use tools but don’t forget what news business is. Don’t over depend on technology.” Arnab Goswami – Republic TV
