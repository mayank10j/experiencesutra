Some of the simple tasks for humans can be very tedious for machines. Image cropping is one of them. It's quite easy for human to identify the important area in a photo and decide the parts to retain or crop. But for machines, it is quite difficult.

[Katna](https://github.com/keplerlab/katna) is a python based open source smart image cropping tool that can intelligently identify important elements of an image and retain it during cropping. Katna content â€” aware algorithm can also retain important texts in the image.
