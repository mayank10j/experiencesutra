The Maker Movement has many definitions, but all of them bring across the same of notion of empowering a person to be more than just a consumer of products. It allows for inventors, designers and tinkerers to express themselves and stresses on the fact that anyone can be a maker.

According to Make Magazine, a Maker Faire is a gathering of fascinating, curious people who enjoy learning and who love sharing what they can do. It’s a venue for makers to show examples of their work and interact with other fellow makers. It is an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, authors, artists, students, and commercial exhibitors.

Maker Faire is primarily designed to be forward-looking, showcasing makers who are exploring new forms and new technologies. But it’s not just for the novel in technical fields, it features innovation and experimentation across the spectrum of science, engineering, art, performance and craft.

The Bangalore Mini Maker Faire 2015, was a celebration of India’s maker culture. The first of it’s kind in the country, this is a precursor to a Maker Faire that is scheduled to happen in 2016. There were makers of all ages showcasing various things that they had created ranging from model trains and pin hole cameras to multi-line refreshable braille displays and robotic arms running on Deep neural networks.

We took our “objecTable” to showcase how experiences could be built using existing technologies by creatively utilizing them. The experience “objecTable” allows every-day objects  like cups and coasters to be recognized through computer vision and puts them into context of the application that is running on a projection mapped table. We are proud to share that “objecTable” was selected in the list of top 5 projects.

With applications such as a map and a sampler for music reimagined for a surface, the community understood the power of ObjecTable as a platform. Kepler’s philosophy of non apparent technology was well received and stirred up interest from people around.  
The crowd at the Maker Faire proved as a brilliant test bed for usability testing ranging from school children of various ages to professionals in the industry, all of whom appreciated the simplicity showcased in running the experience.

The maker mindset is of utmost importance in a digital agency to execute innovate ideas and campaigns. It was an amazing experience and we look forward to 2016 maker faire edition.
