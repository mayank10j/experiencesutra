One of the biggest global concerns of the modern day world is Climate Change and its anticipated effects that include increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels, changing precipitation and the expansion of deserts in the subtropics. Some of the prime culprits in contributing to this climate change and by extension, Global Warming are the man-made pollutants which massively rise from the conventional sources of energy .

In the 3rd week of September 2017, team Kepler attended the Renewable Energy India Expo (REI2017) – Asia’s largest renewable energy convention. The event, held at Greater NOIDA’s India Expo Centre, served as a platform for some of the giants from the renewable energy sector across the continent of Asia.

Global Experiences

One of the attractions of the event was our interactive installation done for Hero Future Energies – one of the leaders in the field of Solar and Wind power. The underlying concept of the experience was to highlight the work being done by HFE in the renewable sector and to apprise visitors of the company’s achievements in the said fields over the last few years. This was a unique installation that combined Computer Vision technology along with a Gaming experience to bring together an interactive storytelling platform. Using the Torch and touch interface as inputs, we designed a breakout game which required the player to ‘power up’ and entire city using light particles or ‘photons’ being released from the Sun. The user first switches on the IR Torch and points in on to the wall. As the torch hits a designated band on the top edge of the projection screen, it releases a photon particle from a random point in a random direction. This was done to establish the vast source available for the generation of light particles and that these particles move in all directions. The particle then moves towards the city-scape where ‘roof top solar panels’ are mounted on buildings. These buildings highlight the sectors across which HFE works – schools, metro rail, commercial and residential projects. As the particle strikes a panel, it powers up that specific building/sector and brings it to life. The user, simultaneously, has to rotate the panel at such an angle so that the reflected particle is directed towards another building which will eventually light it up as well. In addition to the buildings becoming active, each strike also raises a data cloud which talks about the achievements of HFE so far. The final objective of the game was to light up the entire city using the least number of photon particles by making sure that these were not wrongly directed  and wasted – which by extension also highlights HFE’s underlying principle of making the best and most optimal use of available solar energy.

The front end of the experience of was driven by the unity game engine and the inputs were based on 2 separate interactions. One was a touch based input which was responsible for rotating the solar cell panels and the second was the photon particle release which was triggered using Computer Vision with the help of an IR camera.

Team Kepler at REI2017

The wall was experienced by the MD of HFE, Mr Rahul Munjal ; their CEO, Mr Jain and a few current and ex-ministers of the energy sector. Being present at the REI event was a heartening experience – to be amidst thousands of common and influential people, both, who are striving hard to fight the monsters that are destroying our environment and making sure that we have a cleaner and a safer world to look forward to. The important part is, that we all learn and work towards it to the best of our capacity.
